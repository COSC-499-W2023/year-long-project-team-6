Finishing tasks helped us work together better and get better at coding. We also learned to keep things safe, write things down clearly, and make sure everything works well. Putting all the computer parts in one place made things faster. We also learned to keep checking and fixing problems. Right now, we're making another part for people to sign up, and we're making sure it's consistent. Learning never stops in computer work, and teamwork is important for success.
